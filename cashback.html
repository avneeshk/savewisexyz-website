			<h2>Cash Back Monitor by Savewise</h2>
			<h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Methods of receiving cash back and rebates on purchases have existed for decades, from coupons to mail-in offers. As commerce has increasingly moved online, cash back and rebates have been redeemable through “shopping portals”. Regardless of the medium, these cash back platforms all offer the same opportunity: shoppers can receive some form of money or redeemable currency back for purchases they make at a merchant…if they follow the instructions.</p>
            <p>Most shoppers don’t use this money-saving tactic, for 3 reasons:
                <li>
                    <ul>They’re not aware of cash back portals (Awareness)</ul>
                    <ul>They don’t know how to use cash back portals (Usability)</ul>
                    <ul>They don’t trust cash back portals (Trust)</ul>
                </li>
            </p>


            <h4>Awareness</h4>
            <p>
            This is less of a problem than it used to be, largely due to platforms like Rakuten, Honey, and Capital One Shopping spending significant capital on marketing efforts
            Still, just 35% of surveyed consumers have even heard of Rakuten and Honey, 2 of the largest cash back and discount shopping portals. Awareness likely plummets for portals outside the top 3
            </p>
            <h4>Usability</h4>

            <h4>Trust</h4>

            <h3>Shopping Portals 101</h3>

            <p>A shopping portal (e.g. Rakuten, Capital One Shopping, Top Cash Back, etc) are websites that contain rosters of merchants (e.g. Nike, Sephora, Samsung) that they’ve struck partnerships with to drive more purchases.</p>

            <p>A shopper goes to the shopping portal, finds a brand they are interested in purchasing from, clicks through to the merchant from the shopping portal, and when they complete their purchase on the merchant’s site or app, will receive cash back from the shopping portal in exchange for starting their shopping journey on the shopping portal.</p>


            <h4>What’s in this for shopping portals?</h4>

            <p>For each supported merchant, a shopping portal agrees on a “cash back offer”, which is typically a percentage of a user’s pre-tax purchase.</p>

            <p>If the user starts their shopping journey at a shopping portal, and then proceeds to complete a purchase on a support merchant, the shopping portal will award the user the “cash back offer”, and distribute it to the user.</p>

            <p>This is affiliate marketing in a nutshell. Merchants essentially pay shopping portals to drive shoppers to their e-commerce sites and apps. The payment comes in the form of cash back offers. Shopping portals incentivize shoppers to use their portals by passing along portions of that revenue split.</p>

            For example:

            Nike (merchant) and Rakuten (shopping portal) agree to a 10% cut on all purchases that Rakuten is credited for.

            Rakuten then advertises to its users an 8% cash back deal.

            When a user completes a Nike purchase via Rakuten, they receive 8% of their purchase back from Rakuten, while Rakuten pockets the remaining 2% of the 10% partnership deal.

            <h4>What’s in this for merchants?</h4>

            While this seems like it’s too good to be true and isn’t sustainable for merchants, this is just actually just another type of marketing spend for merchants. In the way they spend money on TV commercials, Instagram ads, and mail ads, merchants will allocate a portion of their marketing budget to shopping portals. This can often be more effective for merchants, since shopping portals then do the hard work of finding “high consideration” shoppers (aka people who are “in the shopping mood” and nearly ready to make a purchase).

            <h4>What’s in this for shoppers?</h4>

            <p>Cash back and savings - obviously!</p>

            <p>Savvy shoppers are able to get more money back on their purchases by using shopping portals.</p>

            <p>Extremely savvy shoppers can obtain these cash back in combination with discount codes, sales, and credit card points. This is often called double-dipping (or even triple-dipping).</p>

            <h3>Unique Insight & Opportunity for Savewise</h3>

            <p>In the United States, there are 40-50 high-traffic shopping portals that when combined, support tens of thousands of online merchants. This is a booming industry.</p>

            <p>However, what most shoppers don’t know is that not every portal has the same cash back offer for a given merchant on a given day.</p>

            <p>As an example, here’s a look at Nike’s cash back offers on April 8, 2024 across 5 different shopping portals:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Shopping Portal</td>
                    <td>Cash/Points Earned per $ Spent</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Top Cash Back</td>
                    <td>10%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rakuten</td>
                    <td>8%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>JetBlue Shopping</td>
                    <td>3%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Chase Ultimate Rewards Shopping Portal</td>
                    <td>2%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Capital One Shopping</td>
                    <td>1.5%</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>On top of that, these rates are variable, meaning they change every day.</p>

            <p>Here’s a look at Walmart cash back rate on Rakuten over a recent 7 day period</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Date</td>
                    <td>Cash/Points Earned per $ Spent</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>April 3, 2024</td>
                    <td>8.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>April 2, 2024</td>
                    <td>6.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>April 3, 2024</td>
                    <td>8.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>April 1, 2024</td>
                    <td>12.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>March 31, 2024</td>
                    <td>12.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>March 30, 2024</td>
                    <td>12.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>March 29, 2024</td>
                    <td>12.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>March 28, 2024</td>
                    <td>8.0%</td>
                </tr>
            </table>


            <p>Given the above, there’s no guarantee that a shopper using one shopping portal on a given day to complete a purchase is getting a good deal and maximizing their cash back potential. To do so manually would require manual daily monitoring of dozens of cash back portals to ensure they are getting the optimal cash back offer.</p>

            <h3>Product Solution</h3>
            To help shoppers ensure they are getting a great cash back offer, we’re going to create a tool that compiles and aggregates data about cash back offers into a single tool that walks shoppers through the best path to get the most cash back.

            <h2>We’ll call this the cash back monitor.</h2>

            <p>In short, this tool will monitor every shopping portal, and capture cash back offers for every merchant, every day.</p>

            <p>By doing so, when a shopper wants to buy from merchant X, we can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Tell them the shopping portal to use that will give them the most cash back</li>
                    <li>Recommend whether they should buy now or wait for a better offer</li>
                    <li>Inform them of sign up bonuses for new shopping portals</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
